## Abstract
The field of antibody discovery typically involves extensive experimental screening of B cells from immunized animals. Machine learning (ML)-guided prediction of antigen-specific B cells could accelerate this process, but requires sufficient training data with antigen-specificity labeling. Here, we introduce a dataset of single-cell transcriptome and antibody repertoire sequencing of B cells from immunized mice, which are labeled as antigen-specific or non-specific through experimental selections. We identify gene expression patterns associated with antigen-specificity by differential gene expression analysis and assess their antibody sequence diversity. Subsequently, we benchmark various ML models, both linear and non-linear, trained on different combinations of gene expression and antibody repertoire features. Additionally, we assess transfer learning using features from general and antibody-specific protein language models (PLMs). Our findings show that gene expression-based models outperform sequence-based models for antigen-specificity predictions, highlighting a promising avenue for computational-guided antibody discovery.
